<p>It is, of course.  Certainly it would suck if we overwrote a local file directory and had no means to reconstruct our code and thereby had lost everything that had been written before.  But it's also a lot more than that.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the context of HackReactor or any other kind of rapid software iteration, it is more importantly a workflow tool or force multiplier for the piece of development where we are actually writing code.  Optimally, our workflow is engineered so that we can confidently write without breaking what was functional before.   Also, if the code-writing is as successful as we hoped or anticipated, we can integrate the new code changes into the codebase naturally and elegantly.</p>
<p>This means that the coder must change his perception of a piece of code from a static thing to a dynamic thing.  Similar to perceiving a car as a steering wheel, some axles, a transmission, a tail light and some other things, versus a moving mode of transportation that goes from here to there.  At some level a car is still a car either way but if we can't imagine or use it as a moving vehicle it's largely useless to us.  In the context of coding and git, this means a working command of functionalities like checking out, branching, rebasing, and reverting, still bearing in mind the two goals of seamlessly integrating progress while always preserving prior accomplishments.</p>
<p>To that end, I hope this <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out">link</a> will be helpful.  We should hope to understand how git actually does the things it does, instead of merely knowing the surface effects of a few commands.  I am  in the middle of working through it myself, and it's been very useful for me.</p>
