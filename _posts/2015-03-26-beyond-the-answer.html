<p>There's an awful lot of interest and anxiety about what the effects of technology and software will be for us in the near future, specifically as it relates to the labor market and the possible disruptions of it, and otherwise as well.  Maybe we have anxiety on our own behalf, maybe we're apprehensive about the world in general.</p>
<p>In this context, there's a lot of theories of near future floating around.  The George Mason economist Tyler Cowen has written one that I find to be plausible in the book _Average Is Over_, published a year or two ago.  One of Cowen's main points is that economic value is created by people who leverage technology at least as much or more as those who create it.  There's a statistic that says that only 2% of the economic value of new technology is returned to its creators.  I have no idea of the source or the methodology of that statistic, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's a statistic nonetheless.</p>
<p>But the application that I personally think is interesting is how this could change the nature of quantitative development in the future.  Most or all quantitative development heretofore has been about finding the answer to some quantitative or algorithmic problem.  Eg, how many new cars will be sold in North America next year, or what is the likelihood that Google's stock price will go up in the next hour, etc.  The ability to create credible answers for these kind of questions has been very valuable in the past, and probably will remain so.</p>
<p>But not as valuable as the ability to create capability or trust instead of answers.  This is a difficult paradigm to work in, but one that I suspect we will see more of nonetheless.  As the value and presence of technology has increased in our daily lives, so too has our distrust of it.  Other people have agendas that can be imposed on us through technology, and we resent that and are afraid of it.   But also there is simple incompetence in software development, and also opacity which has largely the same effects.  We don't understand the technology we have access to, so we are afraid of it, and will avoid it.</p>
<p>But there is the possibility that we can develop software, which is interactive or in some other way engages the user so that the users trust it and feel engaged with it.  To the extent that possibility can be realized, it will be widely adopted.</p>
